Absolute Value = abs(x)
round (x) It rounds up the number x to one decimal
round(12/7)
round(x, n) It rounds up number x to n decimals
round(12/7, 8)

maximum of a sequence of numbers
max(x1, x2, x3, ...,xn)

minimum of a sequence of numbers
min(x1,x2,x3,...,xn)

Operators 

 x % n  gives the remainder of the division x:n
 
 x//n  gives the quotient of the division
